(Reuters) - Intel Corp <INTC.O> on Wednesday unveiled "Tiger Lake," the 11th
generation version of its flagship chip for laptops that it hopes will help it 
regain lost market share and counter forthcoming Apple Inc <AAPL.O> machines with
Apple-designed chips.

Intel said the chips use a new manufacturing technique and other tweaks that make
them more powerful at tasks such as using artificial intelligence to reduce
background noise during video calls.

The company said it worked with laptop makers including Dell Technologies Inc 
<DELL.N> and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd <005930.KS> and that 50 machines from 
different makers will be available for the holiday shopping season.

The Tiger Lake processors come as Intel, one of the few chip companies that both
designs and makes its own chips, has struggled with manufacturing delays. The
company has started to lose market share to rivals such as Advanced Micro Devices
Inc <AMD.O> that use outside manufacturers such as Taiwan Semiconductor
Manufacturing Co <2330.TW>.

In a pre-recorded presentation streamed on Wednesday, Intel executives focused on 
real-world performance. Showcasing the new chip's graphics capability, Intel
executives claimed better frame-rate performance than rival chips from Nvidia Corp
<NVDA.O> and AMD, and presented a video clip of a young gamer beating her father
while his laptop lagged.

Intel announced a new co-brand for Project Athena laptops, co-engineered with 
manufacturers, that use Tiger Lake chips called "Intel Evo." The project is aimed
at boosting consumer confidence in sometimes-disappointing claims about features
such as battery life.

Intel Corp reported revenue of 72.0B for FY 2019, an increase of 21.18% compared to 
FY 2016. Net income grew 104.03% to 21.0B. Intel Corp reported total assets of 136.5B
for FY 2019, an increase of 20.47% compared to FY 2016. Debt to Assets is 21.24%.
Intel Corp reported cash flow of 33.1B for FY 2019, an increase of 51.99% compared to
FY 2016. Intel Corp reported Earnings Per Share (EPS) of 4.8 for FY 2019, an increase
of 95.68% compared to FY 2016.
